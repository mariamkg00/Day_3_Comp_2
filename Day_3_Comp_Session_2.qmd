## Vectors in R

```{r}

# if you have quotes, it is a character string, if you have a number, you are trying to input it as a number. 

marmots <- c("blue","green",4, "yellow", TRUE)

class(marmots)

marmots

#if we have values that are all numeric then you have a numeric vector
```

Making a numeric vector:

```{r}
pika <-c(24, 2.3, 5.6, 9)

class(pika)
```

```{r}
# we can have integer values or floats

# for an integer put an L after the values

bear <-c(20L, 3L, 5L, 18L)
```
